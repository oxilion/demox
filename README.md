# DemOX

This is a minimal Django site aimed at demonstrating some basics we use.

## Database

For simplicity an sqlite database is used.

## Requirements

The requirements for the system configuration are listed in requirements.txt.
Use of [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/) and
[pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/) is highly recommended.

We use [Django REST framework](http://django-rest-framework.org/) to build the
API and [South](http://south.aeracode.org/) for database migrations.
